file-desktop-link.exe is an executable file associated with GIMP, a popular open-source image manipulation program developed by The GIMP Development Team, specifically for version 2.10.12.0. This file serves as a desktop shortcut link for quick access to the GIMP application on a user's computer. Generally, it is considered safe as it originates from a reputable publisher and is part of legitimate software; however, like any executable file, it can be misidentified by antivirus programs or be subject to false positives. Users may encounter errors related to this file if GIMP is not properly installed or if there are issues with the system's shortcut configuration, potentially leading to difficulties in launching the application. To ensure safety, it is recommended to download GIMP and its components from the official website or trusted sources, as malicious versions of similar filenames can pose security risks.
