This executable is generally considered safe and is a legitimate component of GIMP; however, like any executable file, it could be flagged by some antivirus programs if it is infected or if it is found in an unexpected location. Users may encounter errors related to file-tiff.exe if there are issues with the GIMP installation or if the file becomes corrupted. To ensure safety, it is advisable to download GIMP from the official website and keep the software updated, as this minimizes the risk of malware disguising itself as legitimate files.
